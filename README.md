You are reading informations about TETRIS-22 game project.
----------------------------------------------------------

This project has been programmed by PERRIN RaphaÃ«l and JOVENIN Eileen.

------
In order to run the program, the only way is to import the file with all its resources on Eclipse or another IDE.
Indeed, running it on a terminal with its jar file would occur an error as the terminal isn't able to read the textures of tetrominoes, sounds and fonts.
------

------
Moreover, you can directly modify the window's size of the game by modifying the "GAME_WIDTH" constant on the Information interface.
It would be useful if your computer's resolution is different than 1920-1080.
